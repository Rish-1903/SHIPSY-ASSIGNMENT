## Overview of AI Assistance
This project was developed with assistance from AI tools (Gemini CLI) to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and best practices.

## Prompt 1: Project Structure Setup
**Context:** Initial project setup and technology selection
**Prompt:** "Create a complete file structure for a MERN stack task manager application with authentication, including all necessary configuration files and folder organization for both frontend and backend."
**Changes Made:** 
- Created optimal project structure
- Set up package.json files with appropriate dependencies
- Configured development tools and scripts

## Prompt 2: Authentication System
**Context:** Implementing secure user authentication
**Prompt:** "Generate a complete JWT authentication system for Express.js with user registration, login, password hashing, and protected route middleware. Include proper error handling and validation."
**Changes Made:**
- Implemented bcrypt password hashing
- Created JWT token generation and verification
- Added protected route middleware
- Included comprehensive error handling

## Prompt 3: Task CRUD Operations
**Context:** Building task management functionality
**Prompt:** "Create MongoDB Mongoose models and Express routes for task CRUD operations with the following fields: title (text), status (enum), priority (enum), isUrgent (boolean), estimatedHours, actualHours, and a calculated efficiencyScore field."
**Changes Made:**
- Designed Task schema with all required fields
- Implemented efficiency score calculation
- Created complete CRUD API endpoints
- Added validation and error handling

## Prompt 4: Frontend Components
**Context:** Building React components for task management
**Prompt:** "Generate React components for a task management interface including task list with cards, create/edit forms with real-time efficiency calculation, and filtering/pagination functionality."
**Changes Made:**
- Created reusable React components
- Implemented real-time form validation
- Added efficiency calculation display
- Built responsive task cards

## Prompt 5: Advanced Features
**Context:** Implementing pagination, filtering, and search
**Prompt:** "Implement advanced features for the task manager including pagination (8 items per page), multiple filters (status, priority, urgency), search functionality, and a statistics dashboard with visualizations."
**Changes Made:**
- Added server-side pagination
- Implemented combined filtering system
- Created search across multiple fields
- Built statistics dashboard with charts

## Prompt 6: Deployment Configuration
**Context:** Preparing for production deployment
**Prompt:** "Create deployment configuration for Vercel including environment variables, build settings, and production optimizations for both frontend and backend applications."
**Changes Made:**
- Configured Vercel deployment files
- Set up environment variables
- Optimized build processes
- Added production-specific settings
